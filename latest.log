Enter the participant ID, or leave blank to use the default value (test): 
What sign, (n)egative or (p)ositive? n
Is this practice (1)/(2), or real thing (r)? r

Generating tgt, this may take a few seconds...
Done generating tgt, thanks for waiting!
PsychImaging: PanelFitter will apply a display rotation of 180 degrees.

PTB-INFO: Will try to use OS-Builtin OpenML sync control support for accurate Flip timestamping.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 4.170294 ms [239.791258 Hz]. (50 valid samples taken, stddev=0.000661 ms.)

PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.

INFO: PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO: a total of 3401 times out of a total of 9459 flips during this session.

INFO: This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO: if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO: If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO: of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO: deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO: examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentation/Psychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.
